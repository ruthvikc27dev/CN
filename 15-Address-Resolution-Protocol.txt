- Congrats! you now understand how both MAC addresses are used at the data link layer and how IP addresses are used at the 
network layer.

- Now we need to discuss how these two separate addresses types relate to each other.
- This is where Address Resolution Protocol or ARP comes into play.
- ARP: A Protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address.
- Once an IP datagram has been fully formed, it needs to be encpsulated inside an Ethernet frame.
- This means, that the transmitting device needs a destination MAC address to complete the Ethernet frame header.
- Almost all network connected devices will retaining local ARP table.

ARP table:
- A list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them.
- Let's say we want to send some data to the IP address 10.20.30.40.
- It might be the case that this destination doesn't have an entry in the ARP table.
- When this happens, the node that wants to send data send a broadcast ARP message to the MAC broadcast address which is all Fs.
- These kinds of broadcast ARP messages are delivered to all computers on the local network.
- When the network interface that's been assigned an IP of 10.20.30.40 receives this ARP broadcast, it sends back what's known as an ARP response.
- This response message will contain the MAC address for the network interface in question.
- Now, the transmitting computer knows what MAC address to put in the destination hardware address field and the Ethernet frame is ready for delivery.
- It will also likely store this IP address in its local ARP table.
- So that it won't have to send an ARP broadcast the next time he needs to comminicate with this IP.
- Handy. ARP table entries generally expire after short amount of time to ensure changes in the network are accounted for.
- So don't expect it to stick around, the way I expect you to stick around for the next ungraded quiz.

Command to retrieve ARP table data in windows -
arp -a

For IPv4:
- Router maintains an ARP table and every computer in the LAN maintains an ARP table.
- Even a switch maintains ARP table

For IPv6:
- It might not, if it isn’t using either Ethernet or IPv4 (or both).
- IPv6 doesn’t use ARP. Nor do most non-Ethernet media.
- There are quite a lot of devices in the worlds cellular networks that are IPv6 only, 
many of which also have no Ethernet interfaces, and yet they route.
