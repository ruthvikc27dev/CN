Different ways of Ethernet Transmission in IPV4 -

Cast - To how many hosts the data to be transmitted.

Uni     -  one to one
Borad   -  one to all
Multi   -  one to many

Unicast:
- Data transmitted from one host to another host.
- The destination host can be in same network & different network.

- A unicast Transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
- At the Ethernet level this is done by looking at a special bit in the destination MAC address.
- If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means that Ethernet
frame is intented for only the destination address.
- This means it would be sent to all devices on the collision domain, but only actually received and processed by the intented destination.


Multicast:
- A big topic (cover if there is time)

- If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means you're dealing
with a Multicast frame.
- A Multicast frame is similarly set to all devices on the local network signal.
- What is different is that it will be accepted or discarded by each device depending on criteria aside from thier
own hardware MAC address.
- Network intrefaces can be configured to accept lists of configured Multicast addresses for these sort of communication.


Broadcast:
- Data transmitted from one host to all the hosts in same/different network.

- An Ethernet Broadcast is sent to every single device on a LAN.
- This is accomplished by using a special destination known as Broadcast address.
- The Ethernet Broadcast address is all Fs. FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
- Ethernet Broadcasts are used so that devices can learn more about each other.
- Don't worry, you;ll be learning more about Broadcast and a technology known as address resolution protocol later
in this course.
- Bit for now, let's move on to dissecting the Ethernet frame.

N1  
- Network 1
- IP - 90.0.0.0

N2  
- Network 2
- IP - 92.0.0.0

- Limited Broadcast
    - If a host in N1 wants to send data to all other hosts in the same Network N1.
    - IP address of Network N1  -  90.0.0.0
    - Broadcast subnet          -  255.255.255.255

- Direct Broadcast
    - If a host in N1 wants to send data to all other hosts in the different Network N2.
    - Broadcast destination IP - 92.255.255.255
