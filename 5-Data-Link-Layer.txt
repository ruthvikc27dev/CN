- Wireless and cellular internet access are quickly becoming some of the common ways to connect computing devices to networks,
and it's probaly how you're connected right now.
- So you might be surprised to hear that traditional cable networks are still the most common option you
find in the workplace and definitely in the data center.
- The protocol most widely used to send across individual links is known as Ethernet.
- Ethernet and the data link layer provide a means for software at higher levels of the stack to send and receive data.
- One of the primary purposes of this layer is to essentially abstract away the need for any other layers to care
about the physical layer and what hardware is in use.
- By dumping this responsibility on the data link layer, the internet, transport and application layers can all
operate the same no matter how the device they're running on is connected.
- So, for example, your web browser doesn't need to know if it's running on a device connected via a twited pair or wireless connection.
- It just needs the underlying layers to send and receive data for it.

- By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to explain what MAC addresses are and how they're used to identify computers.
- You'll also know how to describe the various components that make up an Ethernet Frame.
- And you'll be able to differentiate between unicast, multicast and broadcast addresses.
- Lastly, you'll be able explain how cyclical redundancy checks help ensure the integrity of data sent via Ethernet.
- Understanding these concepts will help to troubleshoot a variety of problems as an IT support specialist.

Warning: A history less on old-school technology is headed your way.

- Here it goes. Ethernet is a fairly old technology.
- It first came into being in 1980 and saw its first fully polished standardization in 1983. 
- Since then, a few changes have been introduced primarily in order to support ever-increaing bandwith needs.
- For the most part though, the Ethernet in use today is comparable to the Ethernet standards as first 
publushed all those years ago.
- In 1983, computer networking was totally different than it is today.
- One of the notable differences in land topology was that the switch or switchable hub hadn't been invented yet.
- This meant that frequently many or all devices on a network shared a single collision domain. 
- You might remember from our discusson about hubs and switches that a collision domain is a network segment where only one 
devices can speak at a time.
- This is because all data in a collision domain is sent to all the nodes connected to it.
If two computer were to send data across the wire at the same time, 30:09 continue.
