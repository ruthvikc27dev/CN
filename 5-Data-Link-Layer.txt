- Wireless and cellular internet access are quickly becoming some of the common ways to connect computing devices to networks,
and it's probably how you're connected right now.
- So you might be surprised to hear that traditional cable networks are still the most common option you
find in the workplace and definitely in the data center.
- The protocol most widely used to send across individual links is known as Ethernet.
- Ethernet and the data link layer provide a means for software at higher levels of the stack to send and receive data.
- One of the primary purposes of this layer is to essentially abstract away the need for any other layers to care
about the physical layer and what hardware is in use.
- By dumping this responsibility on the data link layer, the internet, transport and application layers can all
operate the same no matter how the device they're running on is connected.
- So, for example, your web browser doesn't need to know if it's running on a device connected via a twited pair or wireless connection.
- It just needs the underlying layers to send and receive data for it.

- By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to explain what MAC addresses are and how they're used to identify computers.
- You'll also know how to describe the various components that make up an Ethernet Frame.
- And you'll be able to differentiate between unicast, multicast and broadcast addresses.
- Lastly, you'll be able explain how cyclical redundancy checks help ensure the integrity of data sent via Ethernet.
- Understanding these concepts will help to troubleshoot a variety of problems as an IT support specialist.
