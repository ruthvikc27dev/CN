CSMA/CD:
used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data.

- The way CSMA/CD works is actually pretty simple.
- If there is no data currently being transmitted on the network segment, a node will feel free to send data.
- If it turns out that two or more computers end up trying to send data at the same time, the computers
detect this collision and stop sending data.
- Each device involved with the collision then waits a random interval of time before trying to send data again.
- This random interval helps to prevent all the computers involved in the collision from colliding again 
the next time they try to transmit anything.
- When a network segment is a collision domain, it means all devices on that segment receive all communication
across the entire segment.
- This means we need a way to identify which node the transmission was actually meant for.
- This is where a Media accress control address or MAC address comes into play.
