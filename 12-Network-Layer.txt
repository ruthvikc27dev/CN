- Computers are able to communicate across massive distances at near instant speeds.
- It is a remarkable technical advancement at the root of how billions of people use the internet every single day.

- Earlier in this course, we learned about how computers communicate with each other over short distances or
on a single network segment or LAN.

- In thee next lessens, we'll focus on the technologies that allow data to cross many networks facilitating communications over great distances.
- By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the IP addressing scheme and how subnetting works.
- This means, you'll learn how to perform basic math in binary in order to describe subnets.
- You'll also be able to demonstrate how encapsulation works, and how protocols such as ARP allow different layers of the network to communicate.
- And finally, you'll gain an understanding of the basics behind routing, routing protocols and how the internet works.
- For now, route yourself to the next video and we'll get started.

- On a local area network or LAN, nodes can communicate with each other through thier physical MAC addresses.
- This works well on small scale because switches can quickly learn the MAC addresses connected to each other ports
to forward transmissions appropriately.
- But MAC addressing isn't a scheme that scales well, every single network interface on the planet has a unique MAC address and 
they aren't ordered in any systematic way.
- There is no way of knowing where on the planet a certain MAC address might be at any one point in time,
so it's not ideal for communicating across distances.
- Later on in this lession, when we introduce ARP or Address resolution protocol, you'll see that the way that
nodes learn about each other's physical addressing isn't translatable to anything besides a single network signet anyway.
- Clearly we need another solution and that is the network layer.
- and the internet protocol or IP in the IP  addresses that come along with it.
- By the end of this lesson you'll be able to take identify an IP address, describe how IP datagrams are encapsulated inside
the payload of an ethernet frame and correctly identify and describe the many fields of an IP datagram header.
