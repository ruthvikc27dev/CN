MAC Address -
- A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface.
- It is a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers.
- Just like how binary is a way to represent numbers with only two digits, hexadecimal is a way to represent number
using 16 digits.
- Since we don't have numerals to represent any individual digit larger than nine, hexadecimal numbers employed the letters
A, B, C, D, E and F to represent 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
- Another way to reference each group of numbers in a MAC address is an octet.
- In computer networking, any number that can be represented by 8 bits.
- In this case, two hexadecimal digits can represent the same numbers that 8 bits can.
- Now you many have noticed that we mentioned that MAC addresses are globally unique, which might have left you
wondering how that could possibly be.
- The short answer is that a 48 bit number is much larger than you might expect.
- The total number of a possible MAC addresses that could exist is 2^48 or > 281 trillion addresses.

- A MAC address is split into two sections.
- The first three octets of a MAC address are known as the organizationally unique identifier or OUI.
- These are assigned to individual hardware manufacturers by the IEEE or the institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
- This is a useful bit of information to keeping your back pocket because it means that you can always identify the manufacturer
of a network interface by its MAC address.
- The last three octets of MAC address can be assigned in any way that the manufacturer would like with the
condition that they only assign each possible address once to keep all MAC addresses globally unique.

Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the
transmission, as well as the one the transmission was intended for.

In this way, even on network segment, acting as a single collision domain, each node on that network knows when traffic is intended for it.
