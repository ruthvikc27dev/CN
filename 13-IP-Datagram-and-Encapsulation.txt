- Just like the data packets at the Ethernet layer have a specific name, Ethernet frames,
so do packets at the network layer.
- Under the IP protocol, a packet is usually referred to as an IP datagram.
- Just like any Ethernet frame, an IP datagram is highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined.
- The two primary sections of an IP datagram are the header and the payload.
- You'll notice that an IP datagram header contains a lot more data than an Ethernet frame header does.

IP datagram header -

                                           Bits
0         4                 8                             16         19                          31
| Version |  Header Length  |         Service type        |            Total Length              |
|                   Identification                        | Flags    |      Fragment Offset      |
|           TTL             |        Protocol             |      Header Checksum                 |
|                                      Source IP Address                                         |
|                                 Destination IP Address                                         |
|                    Options                                               |    Padding          |


Version (4 bits):
- The very first field is four bits, and indicates what version of IP is being used.
- The most common version of IP is version four or IPv4
- Version six or IPv6, is rapidly seeing more widespread adoption, 
- But we'll cover that in a later module.

Header Length field (4 bits):
- This is also a four but field that declares how long the entire header is.
- This is almost always 20 bytes in Length when dealing with IPv4.
- In fact, 20 bytes is the minimum length of an IP header.
- You could not fit all the data you need for a properly formatted IP header in any less space.
- Next, we have the Service Type field.

Service type (8 bits):
- These 8 bits can be used to specify details about quality of service, or QOS, technologies.
- The important takeaway about QOS is that there are services that allow routers to make decisions about
which IP datagram may be more important than others.
- The next field is a 16 bit field, known as Total Length field.

Total Length field (16 bit):
- Indicates the total length of the IP datagram it's attached to.

Identification field (16 bit):
- The Identification field, is a 16-bit number that's used to group messages together.
- IP datagrams have a maximum size and you might already be able to figure out what that is.
- Since the total length field is 16 bits, and this field indicates the size of an individual datagram, 
the maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represent with 16 bits: 65,535.
- If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than what can fit in a single datagram, the IP layer needs
to split this data up into many individual packets.
- When this happens, the Identification field is used so that the receiving end understands that every packet with
the same value in that field is part of the same transmission.
- Next up, we have two closely related fields.

The Flag field and the Fragmentation Offset field (16 bits):
Flag field:
- Used to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be Fragmented, or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented.
- or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented.
Fragmentation:
- The process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it up into several smaller datagrams.
- While most networks operate with similar setting in terms of what size an IP datagram is allowed to be,
sometimes, this could be configured differently.
- If a datagram has to cross from a network allowing a larger datagram size to one with a smaller datagram size, 
the datagram would have to be fragmented into samller ones.
- The Fragmentation offset field contains values used by the receiving end to take all the parts of a fragmented packet and 
put them back together in the correct order.
- Let's move along to the time to live or TTL field.

TTL (8 bits):
- This field is an 8 bit field that indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it's thrown away.
- Every time a datagram reaches a new router, that router decrements the TTL field by one.
- Once this value reaches zero, a router knows it doesn't have to forward the datagram any further.
- The main purpose of this field to make sure that when there's a misconfiguration in routing that causes an endless loop,
datagrams don't spend all eternity trying to reach their destination.
- An endless loop could be when router A thinks router B is the next loop, spoiler alert.
- In an upcoming module, you'll learn that the TTL field has valuable troubleshooting qualities, but secrets like these are 
only released to those who keep going.
- After the TTL field, you'll find the protocol field.

Protocol field (8 bit):
- This is another 8 bit field that contains data about what transport layer protocol is being used.
- The most common transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP, and we'll cover those in detail in the next few lessons.
- So next, we have the header Checksum field.

Header Checksum Field (16 bit):
- This field is a Checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header.
- It functions very like the Ethernet Checksum field we discussed in the last module.
- Since the TTL field has to be recomputed at every router that a datagram touches, the Checksum field necessarily changes, too.
- After all of that, we finally get to two very important fields, the source and destination IP address fields.

Source IP address (32 bit):
Destination IP address (32 bit):
- Remember that an IP address is a 32 bit number so, it should come as no surprise that these fields are each 32 bits long.
- Up next, we have the IP options field.

Options ():
- This is an optional field and is used to set special characteristics for datagrams primarily used for test purposes.
- The IP options field is usually followed by a padding field.

Padding ():
- Since the IP options field is both optional and variable in length, the padding field is just a series of zeros used
to ensure the header is the correct total size.

- Now that you know about all the parts of an IP datagram, you might wonder how this relates to what we've learned so far.
- You might Remember that in our breakdown of an Ethernet frame, we mentioned a section we described as the data payload section.
- This is exactly what the IP datagram is, and this process is known as encapsulation.
- The entire contents of an IP datagram are encapsulated as the payload of an Ethernet frame.
- You might have picked up on the fact that our IP datagram also has a payload section.
- The contents of this payload are the entirety of a TCP or UDP packet which we'll cover later.
- Hopefully, this helps you better understand why we talk about networking in terms of layers.
- Each layer is needed for the one above it.
