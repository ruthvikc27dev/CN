Dissecting an Ethernet frame -

- Understanding the networking basics is the first step in building a really strong foundation of networking 
knowledge that you'll need in IT support.

Data Packet:
- An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link.
- The term data packet isn't tied to any specific layer or technology.
- It just represents a concept.
- One set of data being sent from point A to point B.
- Data packets at the Ethernet level are known as Ethernet frames.

Ethernet frame:
- A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order.
- This way network interfaces at the physical layer can convert a string of bits, travelling across a link 
into meaningful data or vice versa.
- Almost all sections of an Ethernet frame are mandatory and most of them have a fixed size.

Ethernet frame:

Preamble (8 bytes)   SFD(1 byte)   Destination Address(6 bytes)   Source Address (6 bytes)   VLAN header (4 bytes)   Ether-type (2-bytes)    Payload (0-1,500 bytes)   ECS (4 bytes)


Preamble:
- The first part of an Ethernet Frame is known as the Preamble.
- A Preamble is 8 bytes or 64 bits long and can itself be split into two sections.
- The first seven bytes are a series of alternating ones and zeros.
- These act partially as a buffer between frames and can also be used by the network interfaces to synchronize internal clocks they use,
to regulate the speed at which they send data.
- This last byte in the preamble is known as the SFD or start frame delimiter.

Start Frame Delimiter:
- Signals to a receiving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow.

Destination MAC address:
The hardware address of the intended recipient.

Source MAC address:
The MAC address from Where the frame originated.

EtherType:
16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame.

VLAN header:
- Indicates that the frame itself is what's called a VLAN frame.
- If a VLAN header is present, the Ether-type field follows it.
- VLAN  stands for virtual LAN.
- A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment.
- Any frame with a VLAN tag will only be delivered out of a switch interface configured to relay that specific tag.
- This way you can have a single physical network that operates like it's multiple LANs.
- VLANs are usually used to segregate different forms of traffic.
- So you might see a company's IP phones operating on one VLAN, while all desktops operate on another.
- After this, you'll find a data payload of an Ethernet frame.

Payload:
- In networking terms, is the actual data being transported, which is everything that isn't a header.
- The data payload of a traditional ethernet frame can be anywhere from 46 to 1500 bytes long.
- This contains all the data from higher layers such as the IP, transport and application layers that is actually being transmitted.

FCS or Frame Check Sequence:
- A 4-byte number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame.
- This checksum value is calculated by performing what's known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame.
- An important concept for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions.
- A CRC is basically a mathematical transformation that uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data.
- Anytime you perform a CRC against a set of data, you should end up with the same checksum number.
- The reason it's included in the Ethernet frame is so that the receiving network interface can infer if it received
uncorrupted data.
- When a device gets ready to send an Internet frame, it collects all the information we just covered, like the destination and
originating MAC addresses, the data payload and so on.
- Then it performs a CRC against that data and attaches the resulting checksum number as the frame check Sequence at the end of the frame.
- This data is then sent across a link and received at the other end.
- Here, all the various fields of the Ethernet frame are collected and now the receiving side performs a CRC against that data.
- If the checksum computed by the receiving end doesn't match the checksum in the frame check sequence field, the data is thrown out.
- This is because some amount of data must have been lost or corrupted during transmission.
- It is then up to a protocol at a higher layer to decide if that data should be retransmitted.
- Ethernet itself only reports on data integrity. It doesn't perform data recovery.
- You've gotten the basics of networking now, nice work.
