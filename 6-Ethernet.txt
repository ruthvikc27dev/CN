Warning: A history less on old-school technology is headed your way.

- Here it goes. Ethernet is a fairly old technology.
- It first came into being in 1980 and saw its first fully polished standardization in 1983. 
- Since then, a few changes have been introduced primarily in order to support ever-increaing bandwith needs.
- For the most part though, the Ethernet in use today is comparable to the Ethernet standards as first 
publushed all those years ago.
- In 1983, computer networking was totally different than it is today.
- One of the notable differences in land topology was that the switch or switchable hub hadn't been invented yet.
- This meant that frequently many or all devices on a network shared a single collision domain. 
- You might remember from our discusson about hubs and switches that a collision domain is a network segment where only one 
devices can speak at a time.
- This is because all data in a collision domain is sent to all the nodes connected to it.
- If two computer were to send data across the wire at the same time, this would result in literal collisions of 
the electrical current representing our ones and zeros, leaving the end result unintelligible.

Ethernet as a protocol solved this problem by using a technique known as carrier sense multiple access with 
collision detection.
