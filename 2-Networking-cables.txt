Networking cables

Cables:
Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them.

Most Networking cables can be splitted into two:
- Copper
- Fiber

- Copper cables are the most common form of Networking cable.
- They are made up of multiple copper wires inside plastic insulator. 
- You already know computer communicate in binary which people represent with ones and zeros.
- The sending device communicates binary data across these copper wires by changing the voltage between two ranges.
- The system at the receiving end is able to interpret these voltage changes as binary ones and zeros, which 
can then be translated into different forms of data.
- The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables.
- These are all shorthand ways of saying category 5 or category 6 cables.
- These categories have different physical characteristics like the number of twists in the pair of copper wires
that results in different usable lengths and transfer rates.
- Cat5 is older and has been mostly replaced by Cat 5e and Cat 6 cables.
- From the outsite they all look the same and even internally, they're very similar to the naked eye.
- The important thing to know is that differences in how the twisted pairs are arranged inside these cables can 
drastically alter how quickly data can be sent across them and how resistant these signals are to outside interference.
- Cat 5e cables are mostly replaced Cat 5 cables because their internal reduce crosstalk.

Crosstalk:
- When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire.
- The receiving end is not able to understand the data causing a network error.
- Higher level protocols have methods for detecting missing data and asking for the data a second time, but of course
this takes up more time.
- The higher quality specifications of a Cat5e cable make it less likely that data needs to be retransmitted.
- That means on average, you can expect more data to be transferred in the same amount of time.
- Cat 6 cables, following even more strict specification to avoid crosstalk, making those cables more expensive.
- Cat 6 cables can transfer data faster and more reliably than Cat 5e cables can, but because of their internal arrangement,
they have a shorter maximum distance when used at higher speeds. 

The second primary form of networking cable is known as fiber. short for fiber-optic cables .

Fiber Optic Cable -
- contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of human hair.
- These tubes of glass can transport beams of light.
- Unlike copper, which uses electrical voltages, fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of 
the underlying data.
- Fiber is even sometimes used specifically in environments where there's a lot of electromagnetic interference from 
outside sources because this can impact data being sent across copper wires.
- Fiber cables can generally transport data quicker than copper cables can, but they're much more expensive 
and fragile.
- Fiber can also transport data over much longer distances than copper can without suffering potential data loss.
- Now you know a lot more about the pros and cons of fiber cables, but keep in mind, you'll be way more likely to run into fiber cables
in computer data centers than you would in an office or at home.
